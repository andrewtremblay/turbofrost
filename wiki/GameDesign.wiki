FEEL FREE TO CHANGE ANY OF THIS. But, the engineering depends on some factors so change it early. 

Hack 'n slash combat. Attacks and spell-casts are in the facing direction.

Item-based; no levels.

Stat points:
  * Str (weap dmg)
  * Agi (move speed, attack rate)
  * Int (LoL AP basically)
  * Def (HP/armor?)

Spells are items. You can equip two spells, and each has a button to cast it.

You have an inventory. Let's not make it a tetris inventory, just for impl. reasons. 

Arrow keys, x attack, c/v spells, i inventory.

PERMA-DEATH?
