= Mechanics =

FEEL FREE TO CHANGE ANY OF THIS. But, the engineering depends on some factors so change it early. 

==Combat==
Hack 'n slash style. 
Attacks and spell-casts are in the facing direction.

==Progression a.k.a. RPG Elements==
Player characters don't "level up".
Item-based: Characters derive their stats from the items they're wielding.

===Stat points:===
  * Str (weap dmg)
  * Agi (move speed, attack rate)
  * Int (LoL AP basically)
  * Def (HP/armor?)

Spells are items. You can equip two spells, and each has a button to cast it.


You have an inventory. Let's not make it a tetris inventory, just for impl. reasons. 

==Controls==
Arrow keys, x attack, c/v spells, i inventory.


==Other Ideas==
===PERMA-DEATH?===
Could make the game more of a rogue-like.
Only problem with perma-death is that it can turn players off from the game, by making them feel like their time invested in that character was a waste.
Perhaps we could allow players to pass on a single item when they die? This would allow them to keep 1 interesting item, and we could potentially scale the generated dungeons based on the starting item a player has, so veteran players don't have to start "from the beginning" when they die.
